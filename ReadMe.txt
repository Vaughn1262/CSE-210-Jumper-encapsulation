Title: Jumper Encapulation project
 
Description: This is a game of Jumper that you can play with the computer. You guess a letter and if its in the randomly selected 
word it is displayed on screen. If not then the number of tries is subtracted by 1.

Project Structure: There are 4 classes that build the word list, select the random word from the word list and make it an array of charcters, and a parachute class that makes a parachute,
and a num_lives class that keeps an integer to represent the parachute. These all go into the program file that actually plays the game.

Required softwate: VS Code, Github, C# interpreter, wordclass.cs, wordlistclass.cs, parachute.cs, program.cs, num_liveclass.cs

Team names: Vaughn Palmer  Pal19037@byui.edu
